![A gas station](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Bp_station_zanesville_ohio.jpg/640px-Bp_station_zanesville_ohio.jpg)

A fuel economy calculator. This tool can be used to quickly calculate your fuel economy when filling up your tank.

Assignment
----------

Create program which does the following in order:

1. Request the mileage at the last fill-up from the user
2. Request the current mileage from the user
3. Display the miles traveled to the user
4. Request amount of gas added to the tank on this fill-up
5. Display the miles per gallon for this fill-up to the user

Here's an example run of a correct program:

    Enter mileage from last fill-up: 1000
    Enter current mileage: 1300
    Miles traveled: 
    300
    How many gallons did you just put in the tank? 8
    You gas mileage for this fill-up was: 
    37.5

Here is a screen recording of a correct run:

The text of your program need not be identical to the above, but the calculated values should be correct.
